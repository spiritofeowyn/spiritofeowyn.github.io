                                        <li>I won every Hackathon the companies had by both severity and number of defects.</li>

                                        <li> I ran the QA side of an Agile team and trained QA testers. I cross trained testers for various projects to quickly onboard them into different projects.
                                        </li>
                                        <li> I wrote wiki articles on complex technical aspects of software for team reference.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>

                                            I did extensive client research(how they were actually using it and specific settings) to improve the quality and efficiency of testing.
                                        </li>
                                        <li> I refactored test plans so they covered more of the programs and much quicker. It started taking 5 full days to run the comprehensive plan with 3 testers, but when I was done it only took 1 tester 8 hours and covered
                                            more. Consequently it got run more often.
                                        </li>

                                    During my college years I volunteered by making websites for various clubs on campus. I hosted, designed and coded them.

                                I have 7 years experience teaching English as a Second Language to Adults, where I presented complex topics in an easy to understand manner while working independantly. This also provided leadership experience.
