                            <p>Hello! My name is Lori-Ann Fretwell.</p>
                            <p> I was raised in the central valley of California where I taught myself html, designed and ran websites for fun. I also learned some white hat sql injections. Realizing how easy it was for such things to be used for harm, I
                                quickly became interested in Cybersecurity. In recent years I earned a Front End Development certificate from Codecademy.
                            </p>
                            <p>In college I created websites for campus clubs and groups as a volunteer of the student association. Unfortunately I listened to those that said that computer science would be too hard for me. I recieved a bachelors in English
                                and Teaching English as a second language. I also studied Japanese. However these skills in critical writing and thinking would serve me well in software testing. I taught English as a second language where I developed
                                presentation and training skills as well as a lot of patience. I have worked WaterFall and Agile.
                            </p>

                            <p></p>
                            <p> I spent over 5 years testing software and took to it like a fish to water. For me it's like an easter egg hunt or a strategy game. It was fun! What do I think a Developer might have not considered about the current product,
                                or the Project managers didn't mention? I became obsessed with reducing defect cost and improving the processes that led to it. For one company I did extensive research into which client settings were being used the most,
                                what browsers, and what clients used the product the most. From there I developed a plan to cover the most used paths most instead of random settings that didn't match what the client saw. After presenting this to the QA
                                teams we increased effective testing. Afterall if I client will never experience a flaw, it won't harm the reputation of the company. I led the charge in improving QA and Dev knowledge by writing deep dive internal wiki
                                articles on how Prefill worked in the product and what parts of the product it could unintentially affect. Technical Articles like these, quick to read and reference reduced defect cost. I also created QA training documents
                                for QA switching projects to reduce lead time. I won every Hackathon I was ever in, by number of defects and the severity of the defects I identified. I bring these analytical and skills in reducing defects to my coding.
                                I enjoy using Acrylic and water colors to paint. I used to run a webcomic, so photoshop was also my friend. Art instills patience and attention to detail. The art on this page is my own. I have used wood, fabric, and clay
                                as art mediums as well. I used to act in plays as well as do the backstage work. Websites are a lot like theatre. The Front end is the part people see and critique. The Backend is where the magic happens. Lights and objects
                                move, Sounds occur but the audience doesn't notice who is making it happen. A well done play can mask errors from the audience the way a good error handler or else if does.
